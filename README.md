# Ai-Cap-n

Ai Cap'n is a Java based game API made using GTGE. It has been developed first and foremost to make it easy to "plug in" bots into a game. This allows developers to concentrate on the logic of their bots rather than other features of a game. This project is currently used for academic purposes.


This API was developed by Solomon See and Paul Inventado, faculty members of the College of Computer Studies at  De La Salle University Manila, Philippines.
